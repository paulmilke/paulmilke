## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub!

- ðŸ“” I recently graduated with a Software Engineering degree from Western Governors University. Most of the repositories you'll find here showcase my projects from that degree.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently advancing my skills in C#, TypeScript, and JavaScript, which I use in my current role as a Quality Assurance Expert. We're working on automated web scripting using Playwright.
- ðŸš€ Iâ€™m seeking an entry-level engineering role to apply my skills and gain practical experience in the field.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I've worked at an incredible startup called TrainerRoad for 6 years. We create an application to help cyclists and triathletes improve their performance through structured interval training.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me!
